# Secrets & environment variables

Audit of 22 Sep 2026. Re-run any time with `npm run scan:secrets` (tracked
files, also a CI step) and `npm run scan:secrets:history` (every commit on
every ref). Neither prints a matched value.

## Where values may live

| Location | Contents | Reaches the browser? |
|---|---|---|
| Vercel project env (Production / Preview) | everything below | only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, inlined at build |
| `.env.local` (gitignored) | local copy of the same | same rule |
| `.env.example` (tracked) | **names only**, empty values | — |
| Source code | nothing — every value is read from `process.env` | — |

`next build` inlines `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` into client chunks by design. Nothing
else is referenced from client code; `src/server/**` and `src/app/api/**` are
the only readers of server variables, and `src/server/firebase-admin.ts`
throws if imported into a client component.

## Safe public variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, shipped to the browser)

| Variable | Why it is safe |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Firebase web API keys identify the project; access is governed by Firestore/Storage rules and App Check, not by the key. **Restrict it to HTTP referrers `plansphere.in`/`*.plansphere.in` in Google Cloud → APIs & Services → Credentials.** |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `_PROJECT_ID`, `_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `_APP_ID`, `_MEASUREMENT_ID` | Public project identifiers |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | The canonical origin |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry DSNs are write-only ingest addresses, public by design |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_V3_SITE_KEY` | reCAPTCHA *site* key (the secret key is never used — App Check verifies server-side with Firebase) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` | Vercel-provided environment name |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_EMULATOR`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*_EMULATOR_HOST`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPCHECK_DEBUG` | Local development switches; unset in production |

## Server-only variables (never prefixed, never in client chunks)

| Variable | Secret? | Used by | Validated at startup |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | **yes** — bypasses all rules | `src/server/firebase-admin.ts`, scripts | required in production |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | **yes** | `src/server/email` | warning if provider=resend without it |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER`, `EMAIL_FROM` | no | `src/server/email` | enum / default |
| `CRON_SECRET` | **yes** | `/api/cron/event-reminders` | warning in production if missing |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT` | **token yes** | build only (source-map upload) | optional |
| `APP_CHECK_ENFORCE` | no | `src/server/app-check.ts` | must not be `true` without a site key |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | **token yes** | `src/server/rate-limit.ts` | both or neither |
| `RATE_LIMIT_OVERRIDES`, `RATE_LIMIT_DISABLED` | no | rate limiting | parsed / switch |
| `ENV_STRICT` | no | startup: refuse to boot on a required-variable error | switch |
| `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST`, `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST`, `GCLOUD_PROJECT` | no | tests / emulator development | — |
| `VERCEL_*` | no | provided by Vercel | — |

Startup validation lives in `src/server/env.ts` and runs from
`src/instrumentation.ts`; the same report is shown by `GET /api/health` and
`/admin/health`.

## Findings of the 22 Sep 2026 audit

**Tracked files:** no secrets. No API key, token, password, private key or
service-account material anywhere in the working tree. All credentials are
read from the environment.

**Client bundles (`.next/static`):** contain the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values only.
No service-account material, private key, Resend key, cron secret, Upstash
token or Sentry token. (The string `RESEND_API_KEY` appears once, as the
*name* in help copy on the admin console.)

**Git history (76 commits, all refs):** no service-account key was ever
committed. Two historical items, both in code that no longer exists on
`main`:

1. The old Django backend (`legacy-history` branch, `pre-rearchitecture`
   tag) committed `backend/config/settings.py` with Django's auto-generated
   `django-insecure-…` development `SECRET_KEY`, and its compiled `.pyc`. The
   backend was deleted in the rebuild and was never deployed with that key in
   production use, so there is nothing to rotate. Delete the two refs from
   the remote when the old code is no longer needed for reference.
2. The Firebase **web** API key was hardcoded in the old Vite app
   (`src/lib/firebase.ts`, built `dist/` bundles, and `_legacy/` during the
   port). That key is public by design and is the same value now served via
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`; restricting it by HTTP referrer (above)
   is the hardening step, not rotation.

**Removed hardcoded secrets:** none were present in the current code. The
audit added the scanner, the CI step, the ignore rules for key files
(`*.pem`, `*.p12`, `*.key`, `serviceAccount*.json`, `firebase-admin-key.json`,
`.sentryclirc`, `.vercel`) and `ENV_STRICT`.

## Operational reminders

- **Rotate the Firebase service-account key** if it was ever pasted into a
  chat, ticket or terminal shared with others: Firebase console → Project
  settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key → update
  `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` on Vercel (base64 of the JSON) → delete the old
  key in Google Cloud IAM.
- Rotate `CRON_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY` and Upstash tokens the same way:
  set the new value on Vercel, redeploy, revoke the old one at the provider.
- Vercel env scopes: keep Production values out of Preview unless a preview
  genuinely needs to send email or write to production Firestore (it should
  not).

## Dependency audit (22 Sep 2026)

`npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities** after this pass (was 12: 1 high, 11 moderate).

| Advisory | Where | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `uuid` <11.1.1 buffer bounds (moderate) and the 7 advisories chained through it (`google-gax`, `gaxios`, `teeny-request`, `retry-request`, `@google-cloud/{firestore,storage}`, `firebase-admin`) | firebase-admin 13.x tree | `overrides.uuid = ^11.1.1`. firebase-admin stays on 13.x: 14.x pulls an ESM-only `jose` that the Vercel runtime cannot `require()` (production 500, fixed in Sprint 1). |
| `postcss` ≤8.5.22 XSS / source-map file read (high) | pinned 8.4.31 inside `next` | `overrides.postcss = ^8.5.28`; build verified. Next stays on 15.5.x — 16 is a major. |
| `@vitest/mocker` path traversal (moderate, dev only) | vitest 3 | upgraded to vitest 5 |
| `gaxios` (moderate) | transitive | `npm audit fix` |

Unused packages removed: eight `@radix-ui/*` components and `date-fns`
(never imported). `sharp` and `google-auth-library`, used by scripts but only
installed transitively, are now declared devDependencies.

Re-check after any `firebase-admin` or `next` upgrade: if a future version
requires a newer `uuid`/`postcss` than the override, remove the override.

## Error handling (22 Sep 2026)

All API routes run through `handler()` in `src/server/api.ts`, which delegates
to `src/server/errors.ts`:

| Thrown | Client gets | Logged as |
|---|---|---|
| `ApiError` (deliberate: 400/401/403/404/409/422/429/503) | its message and code; `Retry-After` on 429 | warning |
| `ZodError` | 400 + field names → messages | warning |
| `AdminNotConfiguredError` | 503 generic (production) / message naming the variable (development) | error + Sentry |
| transient Firestore (`UNAVAILABLE`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, `ABORTED`, lost transaction…) | 503 generic + `Retry-After: 3` | warning + Sentry |
| anything else | 500 generic + `requestId` | error + Sentry, full stack and context |

The `requestId` in a 500 matches the `[error]` log line and the Sentry event.
In development only, responses carry `debug: {name, message}` — never a stack.
Client-side, `toRepositoryError` replaces raw SDK/parse messages with the
operation context; browser camera errors are translated by name.

`GET /api/health` is redacted (pass/fail per check) unless the caller is a
super admin. Page-level: signed-out → sign-in; wrong role → 403 screen
(`AccessDenied`) or the fallback the layout chose; unknown URL → 404;
render failure → `error.tsx` / `global-error.tsx` with a digest, no message.

Regression suite: `tests/unit/error-handling.test.ts` throws hostile errors
(stack traces, filesystem paths, service-account strings, gRPC failures,
non-Error values) through the real `handler()` in production and development
mode and asserts none of a list of sensitive markers reaches the response.
