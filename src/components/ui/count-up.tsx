/**
 * Animates every `[data-countup]` number on the page from 0 up to its real
 * value, progressively — mounted exactly once in the root layout, the same
 * way `Providers`/`ConsentProvider` are (an always-on client component next
 * to the app shell, not a conditional one rendered per `<Kpi>` instance).
 *
 * This replaced an earlier version where the count-up logic lived inside
 * `Kpi` itself as a small "use client" leaf, conditionally rendered by the
 * (hook-free) `primitives.tsx` whenever a Server Component passed `Kpi` a
 * plain number — architecturally the standard, textbook-correct way to
 * compose a client leaf into a server tree, and it worked in every local
 * reproduction (next dev, a genuine `next start` production server, and a
 * from-scratch `npm ci` install matching Vercel's own build command).
 *
 * It still reliably crashed `/f/[festSlug]`'s Server-Component render on
 * Vercel's actual deployment specifically, consistently, across two
 * independent redeploys of the identical, unchanged fix (one a no-op
 * commit, one forcing real recompilation of this exact module) — something
 * about that specific per-instance Server→Client crossing did not survive
 * Vercel's production runtime, for reasons this repo's own logs couldn't
 * surface (production redacts the underlying error, and no Sentry DSN is
 * configured in this deployment to capture it elsewhere).
 *
 * `Providers` proves an always-mounted root-level client component is fine
 * in this same environment (it runs on every page, including the ones that
 * never had a problem), so the count-up feature is kept, implemented this
 * way instead: `Kpi` (in primitives.tsx) stays 100% hook-free and renders
 * the correct final number directly — every page that uses it is exactly
 * as crash-proof as a Server Component that renders plain text, because
 * that is literally all it does now. This controller is the only piece
 * that touches React state, and it never sits in any page's server tree —
 * it finds its targets by querying the DOM after the real page has already
 * rendered and hydrated successfully.
