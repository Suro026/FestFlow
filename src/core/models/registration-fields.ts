/**
 * What a fest asks its students for.
 *
 * Every fest collects a different set of details — one wants a roll number
 * and a department, the next wants a GitHub profile and a resume link, a
 * hackathon wants both. Hard-coding that set means a code change per fest, so
 * the set is data: the super admin marks each field required, optional or
 * hidden, and the registration form is generated from that.
 *
 * Two rules hold the whole thing together:
 *
 *   - the catalogue below is closed. A field the platform does not know about
 *     is a *custom* field, which carries its own label and type. That keeps
 *     the built-in fields mappable onto the student's profile (we can
 *     pre-fill a college from their account) while still allowing anything.
 *   - the same `validateAnswers` runs in the browser for instant feedback and
 *     again on the server for the real decision. The client copy is a
 *     convenience; the server copy is the rule.
