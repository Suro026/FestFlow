/**
 * The permission matrix — the single source of truth for who may do what.
 *
 * Every role check in the app resolves to `can(role, permission)` or
 * `canInScope(...)`. Nothing else re-derives privileges from a role name:
 * rules, API helpers, UI guards and tests all read this table, so adding a
 * capability is one line here rather than a hunt through the codebase.
 *
 * Four roles, least to most privileged:
 *
 *   student     registers for events, holds a pass, collects certificates
 *   volunteer   scans at the gate — entry and meals — and nothing else
 *   admin       runs the fests assigned to them, end to end
 *   super_admin runs the platform, and is the only role that creates admins
 *
 * A public visitor is not a user. Browsing needs no account, and "public"
 * is therefore not a role — it is the absence of one.
