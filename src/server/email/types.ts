 * Email delivery, behind an interface.

 * logger everywhere else). Everything that sends mail goes through
 * `emailService()`, and every send is recorded in the `emailLog` collection
 * with its outcome, so "did the invite go out?" is a query, not a guess.
 *
 * Implementations must not throw for an ordinary delivery failure. A bounced
 * address is normal at fest scale and must not abort a run of four hundred
 * certificates — it is reported per-recipient and recorded on the certificate
 * so it can be retried.
